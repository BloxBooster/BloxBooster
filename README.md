🚀 Roblox FPS Booster & Effect-Animations

A lightweight, open-source utility designed to optimize Roblox performance by unlocking frame rates and managing high-intensity visual effects. Get a smoother competitive edge without sacrificing the core game experience.
🛠 Key Features

    FPS Unlocker: Bypass the default 60 FPS cap for ultra-smooth gameplay on high-refresh-rate monitors.

    Animation Optimizer: Streamlines complex character and environment animations to reduce CPU overhead.

    Particle Manager: Toggle or scale down "lag-heavy" effects like explosions, sparkles, and smoke.

    Low-Latency Mode: Reduces input lag by optimizing the render queue.

    One-Click Presets: Choose between Potato, Balanced, or Competitive profiles.

📥 Installation

    Download: Grab the latest release from the Releases tab.

    Extract: Unzip the folder to your preferred location.

    Launch: Run RobloxBoost.exe before or during your Roblox session.

    Configure: Use the system tray icon to adjust your FPS cap and animation settings.

⚙️ How it Works

The booster interacts with the client-side settings to prioritize performance. By adjusting the way the engine handles Interpolation and Particle Emitters, the app frees up system resources.
Technical Overview

For those interested in the math behind the frame timing:
The application adjusts the frame delta to ensure consistent delivery:
Tframe​=FPStarget​1​

By minimizing Tframe​ fluctuations, you experience less "micro-stuttering" during intense combat.
❓ FAQ

Is this bannable?
This tool operates similarly to standard FPS unlockers. It does not inject code into the game memory or provide an unfair advantage (like aimbots); it simply optimizes how the game renders on your hardware. However, always use at your own risk.

Does it work on Mac?
Currently, this version is optimized for Windows 10/11.
